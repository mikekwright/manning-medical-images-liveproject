## Dataset

This data set contains 200 publicly available pairs of healthy, structural T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2-weighted (T2-w) MR brain images
from the Hammersmith Hospital in London. MR scanners are flexible machines that can be programmed to collect different anatomical
information, which is where these two types of images come from (although there are several other types of images that can be collected).
The information provided by each of these types of images is used by physicians to diagnose and treat patients more effectively; the
complementary information helps physicians disambiguate tissue and abnormalities.

Unlike more traditional images, structural MR images are actually 3D image volumes, i.e., 3D arrays of numbers. And structural MR images
show the anatomy of a patient, as opposed to functional MR images which highlight areas of blood flow. So the numbers in our images
correspond to the intensity of the anatomy due to the type of MR image being collected.
